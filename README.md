# capture-stacks-jwt

This is a repository that contains a Terraform Stacks configuration that captures and exposes the JWTs generated by TFC.

This should only be used to help with debugging and development. You must use a custom version of the agent that strips out the ephemerality of `identity_token` blocks in order to use this stack.
